Repository containing my xEdit scripts I wrote to recursively traversing whatever classes with element records, looking for any regex match for any values (converted to string), and optionally writing a JSON object for the matched records.

Offers vector matching, vector replacement, JSON building, recursive class traversal in Pascal, inteded to be ran in xEdit and jvInterpreter.
